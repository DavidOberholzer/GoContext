# GO Context Examples

## Introduction

This repo contains examples of go context to illustrate it's common/practical usage.

### Examples

1. `server`: A simple go application that hosts a server which shows usage of request context in handlers.
2. `routines`: A simple go application that shows using context in go routines. And how to handle graceful shutdown.

### Running an example

Just `cd` into the example directory and `go run`.

## Notes

- The file structure of these examples is not an example of good go project structure. They serve only to show go context usage.
- These are examples to illustrate the usage NOT production code.
- There are no tests, you should write tests in your code :)
